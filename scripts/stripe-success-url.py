"""Point the Payment Link's confirmation page at docs/success.html.

Stripe finishes a checkout on its own hosted confirmation page unless the link
says otherwise, and a link that redirects somewhere generic — the home page,
say — spends the one moment somebody is pleased with you showing them a page
written for strangers. `success.html` is the page for that moment: it says the
payment cleared, and it says the one thing the payment cannot do for itself,
which is `craft login`.

The redirect is a property of the Payment Link, not of a session, so it is the
same destination for a checkout started by `craft subscribe` and one started by
the Subscribe button on the pricing page. The page is written for both.

    STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_... python3 scripts/stripe-success-url.py           # dry run
    STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_... python3 scripts/stripe-success-url.py --apply

A restricted key with write on Payment Links is enough. Dry run by default: it
prints what the link does now and what it would do instead, and touches
nothing. Changing this affects the next real customer, not a test one.
