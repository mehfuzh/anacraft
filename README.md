## Install

**macOS / Linux**

```sh
curl -fsSL https://anacraft.dev/install.sh | bash
```

Installs to `/usr/local/bin` when that is writable, otherwise `~/.local/bin` —
never with `sudo`. Set `INSTALL_DIR` to choose somewhere else:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://anacraft.dev/install.sh | INSTALL_DIR=~/bin bash
```

**From source**

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/mehfuzh/anacraft
```

**Manual** — grab a binary from [Releases](https://github.com/mehfuzh/anacraft/releases), extract it, and put `anacraft` on your `PATH`.

## Quick start

`anacraft` with no command opens the dashboard — `dash` is the default. With no
property saved it runs on synthetic data, so it works before you sign in.

```sh
# The dashboard, on synthetic data — no Google account needed
craft

# Connect a real GA4 property
craft login        # OAuth sign-in
craft props        # list the properties this account can read
craft use 1234567  # save it as the default

# Same bare command, now against your property
craft
```

### One-shot reports

Not everything needs a dashboard. These print and exit.

```sh
craft overview --days 30   # headline metrics, deltas, achievements
craft pages                # most-visited pages
craft portals              # where traffic arrives from
craft realms               # traffic by country
craft live                 # who is on the site right now
craft demo                 # render an overview from synthetic data
```

Two flags are global: `--property <id>` queries a property other than the saved
default, and `--theme <name>` renders with a palette other than the saved one.

### Piping the numbers somewhere

`overview` takes `--format`, so the same report a person reads as panels can
also leave the terminal as data.

```sh
craft overview --format json            # one object, one line — for jq or a script
craft overview --format slack           # a Block Kit payload, for a webhook
```

`json` answers in the same shape as the `site_status` MCP tool: labelled
metrics with their unit, the previous period, the percentage change, the daily
user series, and the achievements that fired. The window is reported as the
first and last day the API actually returned rather than computed here — GA
resolves `last 7 days` in the property's timezone, which is not necessarily
this machine's.

`slack` wraps the same numbers as blocks. Both print the payload and nothing
else, so a weekly digest is one cron line:

```sh
0 9 * * 1  craft overview --days 7 --format slack \
             | curl -sX POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d @- "$SLACK_WEBHOOK"
```

Neither format needs a subscription — they render a report `craft overview`
already prints for free.

### Claude Desktop

```sh
craft mcp --install          # write the server into Claude Desktop's config
craft mcp --install --demo   # ...pointed at synthetic data instead
craft mcp --uninstall        # take it back out again
```

Restart Claude Desktop and ask it how the site is doing. The block it merges in
leaves any other servers alone:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "anacraft": { "command": "/usr/local/bin/craft", "args": ["mcp"] }
  }
}
```

Needs `craft login` first and an active subscription — without either the
server still starts and its tools say which one is missing, so the client never
reports it as disconnected. `craft mcp --demo` runs on synthetic data without
either. More in [Ask an assistant](#ask-an-assistant).

## Alerts

`craft watch` compares the most recent complete day against the mean of the
days before it and reports what moved further than it usually does. There is
nothing to configure for it to be useful: a site's own history is the
threshold.

```sh
craft watch                      # check once, print what moved, exit
craft watch --every 3600         # keep checking, hourly
craft watch --webhook "$HOOK"    # POST the alert to a Slack incoming webhook
craft watch --format json        # the same finding as one object, for a script
craft watch --demo               # synthetic alerts — no account, no subscription
```

Three things fire. A **drop** or a **spike** past the metric's threshold, and
**silence** — a count that went to nothing against a baseline that was not
nothing, which is what a removed tag or a site that is down looks like from
here. A window with no rows anywhere is reported once, as itself, rather than
as six metrics all going silent.

The defaults are per-metric, because conversions swing by a third on an
ordinary Tuesday and bounce rate does not: 30% for users, sessions and views,
40% for conversions, 25% for average session, 20% for bounce rate. A baseline
under 10 does not fire a count at all — on a site averaging four conversions a
day, one quiet day is a 25% "drop" that means nothing.

Any of it can be tuned per property:

```toml
[[property]]
id = "552157097"

  [property.watch]
  baseline_days = 28   # days the baseline averages over
  min_baseline  = 10   # a baseline under this never fires a count
  users         = 25   # % deviation that wakes somebody
  conversions   = 40
  bounce_rate   = 15
```

Keys are `users`, `sessions`, `views`, `conversions`, `bounce_rate`,
`avg_session`, or the GA4 API name if you prefer it. `--baseline <days>`
overrides the window for one run.

**What lands in Slack.** Each alert carries the metric, the day's value, how
far it moved, and the baseline it moved away from — plus a sparkline of the
whole window ending on the day being reported, because "38% below normal" does
not say whether the number slid all week or fell off a cliff last night. Where
one channel carries most of a move, it is named: *mostly Organic Search — 96
against 331 (79% of the move)*. Counts only, and only when that channel
accounts for at least 35% of the total movement — under that the move was
site-wide, and naming its largest slice would read as a cause. The message
carries a link back to the property in GA4, and a red or amber bar down its
side so an alert is told from everything else in the channel before a word of
it is read.

The same day's alert is only sent once. State lives in `~/.anacraft/watch.json`
and is keyed by the day being reported on, so `--every 3600` sends one message
about a drop rather than twenty-four, and a new day is news again. It is
recorded only after delivery succeeds — a webhook that was unreachable has
told nobody anything, so the next pass tries again.

**Exit codes.** `0` when nothing fired, `2` when something did, `1` on an
error. So a shell can decide for itself:

```sh
craft watch --format slack \
  || craft watch --format slack | curl -sX POST -d @- "$SLACK_WEBHOOK"
```

`--format slack` prints nothing at all on a quiet day, which is what keeps a
cron line from posting an empty message every hour. In a loop, `--webhook`
does the POST itself — a daemon has nothing to pipe into.

`--format` chooses what the webhook receives, so a URL pointed at something
other than Slack gets a shape it can read: `--format json --webhook <url>`
posts the JSON object. Two exceptions. Panels have no wire form, so leaving
`--format` alone and passing a webhook posts the Slack blocks. And a
`hooks.slack.com` URL always gets blocks whatever `--format` says, because
Slack answers a bare JSON object with `400 no_text` — the destination wins
over the flag there, which is what keeps `craft slack --install` from turning
`--format json` into an error.

### Installing into Slack

Making a webhook by hand is six steps in a developer console. `craft slack`
does it the way `craft login` does Google:

```sh
craft slack --install     # opens Slack; pick the workspace and channel there
craft slack --test        # post one message, to check it before an alert needs to
craft slack               # say where alerts currently go
craft slack --uninstall   # forget the webhook (the app stays installed in Slack)
```

Slack's own install screen carries the workspace and channel pickers, and the
`incoming-webhook` scope returns the URL in the OAuth response — so nothing is
copied by hand. `craft watch` then needs no `--webhook` at all.

One scope, and the narrowest one that works: permission to post to the single
channel you pick. Not `chat:write`, which would be permission to post anywhere
in the workspace.

The webhook URL comes from `--webhook`, then `ANACRAFT_WEBHOOK`, then whatever
`craft slack --install` saved in `~/.anacraft/slack.json` — and deliberately
**not** from `config.toml`. That file is meant to be safe to commit to a
dotfile repo, and a URL that can post into your Slack is not.

`--webhook` stays for cron, CI, and workspaces where you cannot install apps.

`craft watch` is part of the subscription, the same as `craft mcp`.
`craft watch --demo` is not, so what an alert looks like can be seen before
anything is paid for or wired up.

## The dashboard

Seven panels, each toggleable. Turn off what you do not care about and the rest
reflows to fill the terminal.

| Key | Panel | What it shows |
|-----|-------|---------------|
| `1` | **EVENTS** | Event count per day, this period drawn over the last one, with the total and its change |
| `2` | **RIGHT NOW** | Live player count plus a spawn / wander-off event feed |
| `3` | **COUNTRIES** | Traffic plotted on a world map |
| `4` | **TOP PAGES** | Most-visited pages with view bars and rank movement |
| `5` | **VITALS** | Users, sessions, views, conversions, bounce rate, avg. session |
| `6` | **TOP COUNTRIES** | Ranked countries with tier markers |
| `7` | **DAILY USERS** | User trend across the period |

### Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `1`–`7` | Toggle a panel — `e` `l` `m` `p` `v` `g` `d` do the same |
| `t` | Cycle the palette, and save it |
| `s` | Demo only — preview the Anacrafter look |
| `r` | Rebuild — force a refetch now |
| `?` / `h` | Help overlay |
| `q` / `Esc` | Quit |

## Palettes

```sh
craft theme                # list the palettes with swatches
craft theme tokyo-night    # switch and persist
craft --theme github dash  # override for one run
```

`osaka-jade` (default) · `catppuccin` · `github` · `tokyo-night` · `catppuccin-latte`

The ore vocabulary — diamond, gold, redstone, lapis — is mapped onto whichever
palette is selected, so the texture pack survives a theme swap.

The command is `craft`. `anacraft` is installed alongside it as an alias, so
older scripts and anything you have in muscle memory keep working.

## Ask an assistant

`craft mcp` serves the dashboard's numbers over the [Model Context
Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io), so Claude Desktop, Claude Code, or
any MCP client can answer "how is the site doing" without a human reading a TUI.

```sh
craft mcp --install          # write the server into Claude Desktop's config
craft mcp --install --demo   # ...with `--demo` in the args it writes
craft mcp --uninstall        # take the server back out of that config
craft mcp                    # the server itself; clients spawn this, you rarely do
craft mcp --demo             # synthetic data, no Google account, no subscription
```

Claude Desktop is [one command](#claude-desktop). For Claude Code it is
`claude mcp add anacraft -- craft mcp`; any other client takes the same command
and argument. Writing a config by hand, use an **absolute path** — a desktop app
is not launched from a shell and does not inherit the `PATH` where `craft`
works. `which craft` gives the value to paste.

| Tool | Answers |
|------|---------|
| `site_status` | Headline metrics against the period before, the daily user series, and the achievements that fired |
| `live_visitors` | Who is on the site right now, by country |
| `list_pages` | Most-visited pages |
| `list_events` | Events by count, with the per-day total against the previous period |
| `list_referrers` | The URLs sending traffic |
| `list_traffic_sources` | GA4 source / medium pairs |
| `list_countries` | Traffic by country |
| `list_properties` | Every property this account can read |
| `search_pages` | Pages whose path contains a substring |
| `search_events` | Events whose name contains a substring |

Every tool takes an optional `property` and falls back to the saved default, so
an assistant that knows nothing about your config still gets answers. Responses
are structured JSON — labelled numbers carrying the property id and the date
window they cover, not rendered panels.

**Read-only.** Nothing here starts an OAuth flow, writes to `~/.anacraft/`, or
changes the default property: `login` and `use` stay human-only commands. If no
credentials are stored the tools say to run `craft login` rather than opening a
browser inside your client's subprocess. Identical reports
are cached for a minute so a chatty agent does not burn the GA4 quota that the
dashboard needs.

**Subscription.** `craft mcp` needs an active subscription — `craft subscribe`
for $2.99/month or `craft subscribe --annual` for $29/year. It opens Stripe,
waits for the payment to clear, and writes `supporter = true` itself; the
dashboard and the MCP server re-check on launch and keep that line current. The
record is keyed to the Google account you signed in with, so a second machine
only has to `craft login` — add `--check` to look it up without opening a
browser. Missing it does not take the process
down: an MCP client reads an early exit as "server disconnected", which says
nothing about what to fix, so the server starts, the handshake succeeds, and
every tool call answers with the sentence that gets you unstuck. The same goes
for a missing login. `craft mcp --demo` is ungated, so the server can be wired
up and looked at first.

## Configuration

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `~/.config/anacraft/config.toml` | Properties and their settings |
| `~/.anacraft/token.json` | OAuth refresh token, written by `login` |

Config honours `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`. Tokens stay out of `~/.config` on purpose —
that directory ends up in dotfile repos, and a refresh token has no business
travelling with it. A pre-0.4 `~/.anacraft/config.json` is migrated on first run.

### Multiple properties

`craft use <id>` adds a property rather than replacing the last one, so the
config accumulates. In the dashboard, `tab` cycles between them, and whichever
one you quit on becomes `active` — so the dashboard and the rest of the CLI do
not disagree about which property is the current one. Passing through on the
way somewhere else costs nothing; landing is what commits it.

`active` is what every command reads when you do not say otherwise. The order
is `--property <id>`, then `ANACRAFT_PROPERTY_ID`, then `active`, so a flag or
an exported id will quietly outrank `craft use` for as long as it is set.

```toml
active = "397412345"
theme  = "osaka-jade"        # palette for any property that doesn't name one

[[property]]
id           = "397412345"
name         = "anacraft.dev"
label        = "site"        # shown instead of name in the switcher
theme        = "catppuccin"
days         = 14
refresh      = 60
live_refresh = 5

[[property]]
id = "88820011"              # everything optional: inherits the defaults
```

Every key under `[[property]]` is optional and falls back to the global default,
so switching to a property that saved nothing lands on the defaults rather than
inheriting the previous property's window. Command-line flags beat both.

`ANACRAFT_PROPERTY_ID` overrides the saved property if you would rather not keep
one on disk.

### Your own OAuth client

Official builds carry one, so `craft login` works with no setup. To use your own
instead, set `ANACRAFT_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` and `ANACRAFT_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`, or
write `~/.anacraft/client.json`. Both take precedence over the built-in client,
and registering your own Google Cloud project also insulates you from other
people's quota consumption.

## Setting up GA4

The Google side — property, data stream, tag, access management, API enablement
— is documented at [anacraft.dev/setup-ga4](https://anacraft.dev/setup-ga4.html).

Cloned the repo and use [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)? The same
guide ships as a skill in `.claude/skills/google-analytics-setup/`. Ask Claude to
configure Google Analytics and it walks the console steps with you, including
tag installs per framework and what to check when nothing arrives.

`.claude/skills/anacraft/` covers this side of the line — installing, connecting
a property, driving the dashboard, wiring up `craft mcp`, and what each error
message actually means. Ask Claude to set anacraft up, or paste a failing
command at it.

## Requirements

- A Google Analytics 4 property
- A terminal with truecolor support
- Rust 1.74+, if you are building from source

## Contributing

`cargo run -- dash --demo` gets you a working dashboard with no Google account
attached. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the layout of the code and
