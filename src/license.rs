//! The subscription record.
//!
//! Stripe cannot reach a binary on somebody's laptop, and a Stripe key shipped
//! inside a downloadable binary is a key that has leaked. So the payment and
//! the machine meet in the middle, at a Supabase project:
//!
//! 1. `craft subscribe` mints a token, writes a pending row keyed to the signed
//!    in Google account, and opens the site's pricing page carrying that token,
//!    which the page forwards onto Stripe as the checkout's
//!    `client_reference_id`. The page rather than the card field, because a
//!    command should not spend somebody's money one click sooner than they
//!    meant to.
//! 2. Stripe's webhook (`supabase/functions/stripe-webhook`) fills that row in
//!    with the customer, the subscription and its status, and keeps it current
//!    as the subscription renews, lapses or is cancelled.
//! 3. Every `craft dash` and `craft mcp` asks Supabase what the account's
//!    status is and caches the answer.
//!
//! Keying on the Google account id — not on the token, not on the machine — is
//! what makes a new laptop work: sign in, and the subscription is already
//! there. The token is kept as a second key so a checkout that finished before
//! the identity landed still resolves.
//!
//! Only two calls exist, both `security definer` RPCs, and the binary carries
//! the anon key, which is public by design: the table itself is closed to it.
//! The worst an anon key can do here is ask about one account and write one
//! pending row.
//!
//! Nothing here is a hard gate. The cached answer lands in `supporter`, a line
//! of TOML in a config anybody can edit, in a binary anybody can rebuild. It
//! closes the loop for people who paid; it does not stand between anybody and
//! their own analytics.
