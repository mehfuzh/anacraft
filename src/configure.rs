//! `craft configure <domain>` — the setup guide, run as a command.
//!
//! `docs/setup-ga4.html` is the most-read page on the site, and steps 01–03 of
//! it are the reason: create a property, add a web data stream, copy the
//! measurement id into a snippet. None of that is a decision. It is four
//! screens of console navigation standing between somebody and their first
//! number, and every one of those screens is an Admin API call.
//!
//! So this does the three steps and prints the tag with the real id already in
//! it. What it deliberately does not do is guess: it will reuse a property
//! that already measures the domain rather than quietly create a second one,
//! and it stops and asks when the account is ambiguous.
//!
//! This is the only command in anacraft that writes anything to a Google
//! account, and it asks for the permission to do so itself — see
//! `auth::ensure_scope` and `docs/oauth-scopes.md`.
//!
//! MCP's `configure_site` tool runs this same core — see [`setup`] — with the
//! browser consent swapped for a check of the stored grant, because a client's
//! subprocess has no browser to open. The result comes back as data; how and
//! where it is said is the caller's, a terminal's panels or a tool's JSON.
//!
//! Which is also why it is the command that asks for the subscription: the
//! guide is the most-read page on the site, and this is its first line, so the
//! people running this are the people who are actually here. `Paywall` below
//! is the whole of that, and the shape of it is that the ask arrives on the
//! page the sign-in already ends on rather than in a tab of its own.
//!
//! `craft delete` is the other half, and deliberately the asymmetric one. On
//! its own it only forgets a property locally and hands the console the
//! destructive click. `--all` is the second half of that asymmetry rather than
//! the end of it: a property this command created in one line should not need
//! four console screens to take back, so the flag exists — but it has to be
//! typed, it is never what a bare `craft delete` does, and what it reaches for
//! is Google's soft delete, which leaves the property restorable from the
//! account's own trash for 35 days. The grant is one scope wide and the code
//! keeps using less of it than the scope allows; see `docs/oauth-scopes.md`.
