//! `craft watch` — the numbers, checked against their own recent normal.
//!
//! The dashboard answers "how is the site doing" when somebody thinks to ask.

//! configuration to be useful — a site's own history is the threshold.
//!
//! Three things it deliberately does not do. It does not decide whether a
//! move was good, only how far it went and in which direction. It does not
//! read a webhook URL out of `config.toml`, which the README calls safe to

//! not that, so it comes from the flag or the environment. And it does not
